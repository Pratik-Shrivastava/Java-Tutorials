# Classes and Objects in Java

In Java, **Classes** and **Objects** are the fundamental building blocks of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). They allow us to model real-world entities, organize code efficiently, and facilitate reuse.

## What is a Class?

A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects created from the class will have.

### Syntax of a Class

```java
class Student {
    
    String name;
    int roll;    
}
```
In the above example:

- The class `Studet` defines two attributes: `name`, and `roll`.
