# Java Syntax and Structure

- Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that follows a well-defined syntax and structure.
- Understanding the basic syntax and structure of a Java program is essential for writing Java applications.

## Basic Structure of a Java Program

A typical Java program consists of the following components:

1. **Class Declaration**
2. **Main Method**
3. **Statements and Expressions**
4. **Comments**

### Example: Basic Structure

```java
// This is a simple Java program

// Class declaration
public class HelloWorld {

    // Main method: Entry point of the program
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Statement to print "Hello, World!"
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
